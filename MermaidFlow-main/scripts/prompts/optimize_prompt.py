WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZE_PROMPT = """You are building a Graph and corresponding Prompt to jointly solve {type} problems. 
Referring to the given graph and prompt, which forms a basic example of a {type} solution approach, 
please reconstruct and optimize them. You can add, modify, or delete nodes, parameters, or prompts. Include your 
single modification in XML tags in your reply. Ensure they are complete and correct to avoid runtime failures. When 
optimizing, you can incorporate critical thinking methods like review, revise, ensemble (generating multiple answers through different/similar prompts, then voting/integrating/checking the majority to obtain a final answer), selfAsk, etc. Consider 
Python's loops (for, while, list comprehensions), conditional statements (if-elif-else, ternary operators), 
or machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, clustering). The graph 
complexity should not exceed 10. Use logical and control flow (IF-ELSE, loops) for a more enhanced graphical 
representation.Ensure that all the prompts required by the current graph from prompt_custom are included.Exclude any other prompts.
Output the modified graph and all the necessary Prompts in prompt_custom (if needed).
The prompt you need to generate is only the one used in `prompt_custom.XXX` within Custom. Other methods already have built-in prompts and are prohibited from being generated. Only generate those needed for use in `prompt_custom`; please remove any unused prompts in prompt_custom.
the generated prompt must not contain any placeholders.
Considering information loss, complex graphs may yield better results, but insufficient information transmission can omit the solution. It's crucial to include necessary context during the process."""

Referring to the given workflow composed of old Mermaid diagram code and prompts, which forms a basic example of a {type} solution approach, please use the new_graph and prompt to generate Python code based on this example.

## Implementation Requirements:
- After creating the new Mermaid workflow, generate the corresponding Python code implementation
- Effectively utilize Python programming structures:
  * Loops (for, while, list comprehensions)
  * Conditional statements (if-elif-else, ternary operators)
  * If relevant, consider appropriate machine learning techniques

## Output Requirements:
- Corresponding code implementation
- Include all necessary prompts in prompt_custom (only include what's needed)
- Only generate prompts used in the Custom method as `prompt_custom.XXX`
- Ensure generated prompts don't contain any placeholders
- The output Python code must follow proper syntax and not include any irrelevant content

Remember: While complex diagrams may yield better results, ensure sufficient information transmission throughout the process to avoid omitting critical solution components."""

Here is a graph and the corresponding prompt (prompt only related to the custom method) that performed excellently in a previous iteration (maximum score is 1). You must make further optimizations and improvements based on this graph. The modified graph must differ from the provided example, and the specific differences should be noted within the <modification>xxx</modification> section.\n

Below are the logs of some results with the aforementioned Graph that performed well but encountered errors, which can be used as references for optimization:
{log}

First, provide optimization ideas. **Only one detail point can be modified at a time**, and no more than 5 lines of code may be changed per modification—extensive modifications are strictly prohibited to maintain project focus!
When introducing new functionalities in the graph, please make sure to import the necessary libraries or modules yourself, except for operator, prompt_custom, create_llm_instance, and CostManage, which have already been automatically imported.
**Under no circumstances should Graph output None for any field.**
Use custom methods to restrict your output format, rather than using code (outside of the code, the system will extract answers based on certain rules and score them).
It is very important to format the Graph output answers, you can refer to the standard answer format in the log.
